# RAXY Animation

RAXY Animation is a wrapper for Animancer, providing a dedicated controller for playing animation clips with added features.  
Each AnimationClip is wrapped with a speed multiplier, and the module includes AnimationEventTools to easily edit event names or parameters without opening the Animation tab.
